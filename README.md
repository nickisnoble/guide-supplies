# Guide Supplies

Guide Supplies is a collection of tools and generators to help guides (game masters) run Quest games.

## What is Quest?

[Quest](https://www.adventure.game?ref=guide-supplies) is a new RPG from the Adventure Guild. If you've never played a table top role playing game before, and you've always wanted to, Quest is the best place to start.

You can [learn the basics for free](https://www.adventure.game/basic-rules?ref=guide-supplies) or [buy the full game](https://www.adventure.game/store?ref=guide-supplies) on Adventure Guild's site.

*Disclaimer: Guide Supplies is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Adventure Guild in any way. I just love what they've created, and wanted to add to the community!*


## Contributions & Suggestions

There are many ways to contribute to Guide Supplies, even if you don't code!

I'm open to anything (just open an issue!), but here are a few ideas:

- Additional table content / lore (ideal format is a spreadsheet)
- Ideas for new tools
- Code / site improvements
- Art or illustrations

I will never charge for access to the site, especially since the content is borrowed with permission. That being said, I accept donations which go toward hosting + domain costs... and coffee while I'm coding. Cashapp / venmo $nickisnoble.


## Other Systems

While these tools are built with Quest in mind, they could also be useful for other TTRPG systems, like D&D 5E.

## Special thanks and credits

First and foremost, thank you to @tc and everyone at Adventure Guild for making the best and most accessible TTRPG ever.

[/r/BehindTheTables](https://www.reddit.com/r/BehindTheTables/comments/5ruebp/new_rules_for_behindthetables/) is a wonderful source for game system agnostic tables. I used a few of these, as well as a healthy dose of original material.

[DonJon](https://donjon.bin.sh/) was a big inspiration for these sorts of tools and the code behind them. Amazing site.

And last, but not least, my adventuring party: David, Ali, Rachel, Matt, and Andrew. Thank you for your help generating the original lore here, as well as the endless fun and inspiration from our games. A round of warm milk for all. \[*Edit:* Yes, this is an inside joke.\]
